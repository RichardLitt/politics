Because the actions and policies of the Government of Burma continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on May 20, 1997, and the measures adopted on that date, on July 28, 2003, in Executive Order 13310, on October 18, 2007, in Executive Order 13448, and on April 30, 2008, in Executive Order 13464 to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond May 20, 2010. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Burma. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.
