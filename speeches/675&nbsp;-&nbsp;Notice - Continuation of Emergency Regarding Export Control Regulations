675&nbsp;-&nbsp;Notice - Continuation of Emergency Regarding Export Control Regulations

August 12, 2010

None

Because the Export Administration Act has not been renewed by the Congress, the national emergency declared on August 17, 2001, must continue in effect beyond August 17, 2010. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13222. 

This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.
